Spellcasting - The Unit casts Size spells. Spells that target self require using all of these, it makes logical sense, etc. Ask Eliana for more details.
Mage Daggers - This is a unit attack. It affects every enemy unit or creature touching the unit on the front or sides. Save DC is 15 to halve 5*(side length touching) piercing damage.
Cantrips - Choose an area within 120ft of the Unit that is of size Size 5x5 squares. Each creature in that area must make a Dex save of DC 19 or take 3d10 force damage times the number of squares they occupy in that area. They take half damage on a success.
