Luna’s Chosen - Once every 7 days, all creatures within sight of En’ke’sheti must make a DC 21 WIS safe or be affected as if by Modify Memory to eliminate her from the picture in some way she chooses. The scenery within sight of her warps to match that memory, and she teleports back to her room at Ilumeo.
