Traits
Fire Soul - Levadra’s spells that deal fire damage ignore resistance.
Manifestation (1/long rest) - Once per long rest, Levadra may take a bonus action to manifest her fiery nature.

She can expend 6 sorcery points to regain an expended use of this trait.

	1) 1 sp to double the range or give a touch spell range 30 ft
	2) 1 sp to give up to 5 creatures automatic success on saving against one of her spells
	3) 1 sp to reroll a missed attack
