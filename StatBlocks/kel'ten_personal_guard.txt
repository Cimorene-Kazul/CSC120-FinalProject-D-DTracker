Traits
Unit - Most values are given in terms of unit Size, which for Kel’ten’s guard is 20. As HP decreases, Size decreases to HP/125, rounded up. They occupy an area equal to Size squares.
Unit Cohesion - Creatures and Units that end their turn on the unit border take 2d6 piercing damage. (note: +8 to hit opportunity attacks, 1d8+4 slashing on a hit). Other units cannot enter their space.

Actions
Crossbow Bolts - Every creature within a shape of area equal to the size of the guard unit must make a DC 16 DEX save. This rectangle must be within 100 feet of (and no less than 0 feet from) the front of the guard. On a failure, they take 3d10+6 piercing damage. On a success, they take half that
Swords - This is a unit attack. It affects every enemy unit or creature touching the unit. Save DC is 18 to halve 30*(side length touching) slashing damage.
